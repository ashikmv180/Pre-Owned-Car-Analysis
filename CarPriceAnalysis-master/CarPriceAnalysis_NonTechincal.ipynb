    "\n",
    "When shopping for a used vehicle, typically an overriding concern is: ** *Am I paying too much?* **  This question is often difficult to answer due to the fact that it's hard to keep track of all the vehicles of interest currently available on the market. \n",
    "\n",
    "A second, and related concern, is: ** *Which vehicles with similar specifications are available?* ** This information can help the buyer get a feel for what else is available on the market and provide an indication of the value of the vehicle currently under consideration.\n",

    "# 2. Goal:\n",

Additionally, the code will provide recommendations for related vehicles with a lower price, lower miles, and one that is slightly more expensive. "

    "\n",
    "In order to determine if a vehicle is a good value or not, I will use linear regression to predict the price distribution for each combination of year, make, and model, and then compare it to the actual price. If they are similar, then it is 'reasonable,' otherwise, the shopper may want to investigate why the vehicle is priced too high or low vs the prediction. \n",

    "This problem is ideally suited Bayesian methods, specifically to using a hierarchical model. Due to the large amounts of variability within the data down to level of trim, a traditional linear regression would likely have trouble producing reasonable predictions, even if the regression was done independently for each year, make, and model. Limiting it further by trim levels would negatively impact the performance due to potentially small sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get around this issue, I use a Bayes hierarchical model that predicts a price given the miles of a vehicle taking into account known information about prices based on year, make, model and trim. This gives a distribution of estimated prices (posterior probabilities), against which the original asking price can be compared."

A narrow distribution implies that there were many data points and that the confidence of the average price for that make-model-year-trim combination is high. This is another way of saying that the credible interval is small. A broad curve indicates that there is more uncertainty in the predicted price. The basic idea here is that if the parent vehicle is not near the predicted average price, then the user should try to understand the discrepancy (i.e., low/high miles).\n",

    "# 6. Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most data science problems, this work would have undoubtedly benefitted from cleaner (and more) data. While the details provided in the downloaded listings are quite comprehensive, I was only able to include a small number of the features. And some features, especially *trimName*, were very unreliable. Many of the trim names had multiple variations of the same name, and some had complete nonsense like 'lease this car now!'. I was not able to develop code capable of cleaning up the discrepancies between the various names, and I suspect this had a negative impact on both the regression and recommendation calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "There was an additional data set available at [fueleconomy.gov](http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml) that contains even more information about specific models. I wasn't able to combine this with my dataset, again in large part due to the issues with trimName. Including that data would provide many more features that would especially enhance the content-based recommendation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Future Work:\n",
    "- Include additional description in the price distribution plot to indicate the *reasonableness* of the price\n",
    "- Look more in-depth at pricing strategies between different dealers, regions, seasons, etc\n",
    "- Investigate more thoroughly the factors that go into pricing. While this model only considered miles and trim, there are many other factors that can be used\n",
    "    - Exterior and interior color\n",
    "    - Engine, transmission, drive type\n",
    "    - Cost to own (based on EPA information)\n",
    "- Collect data over time and predict price trends for each vehicle\n",
    "    - How fast will it depreciate?\n",
    "    - What determines the rate of depreciation?\n",
    "- Build in a way to make the output attractive and interactive"
